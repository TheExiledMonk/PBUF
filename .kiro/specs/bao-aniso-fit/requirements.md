# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a dedicated BAO (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) anisotropic fitting pipeline that operates independently from the joint fitting system. The goal is to recreate previous code results while maintaining proper separation between isotropic and anisotropic BAO analyses, as it's not standard practice to include both in joint fits.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cosmologist, I want to perform BAO anisotropic fits independently, so that I can analyze anisotropic BAO signals without interference from isotropic BAO data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the BAO anisotropic fit THEN the system SHALL process only anisotropic BAO datasets
2. WHEN the fit is executed THEN the system SHALL NOT include isotropic BAO data in the same analysis
3. WHEN the fit completes THEN the system SHALL produce results comparable to previous code implementations
4. IF the user attempts to include both isotropic and anisotropic BAO in joint fits THEN the system SHALL prevent this configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the BAO anisotropic fit to use appropriate parameters and priors, so that the analysis follows cosmological best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the fit THEN the system SHALL use anisotropic-specific parameters (alpha_parallel, alpha_perpendicular)
2. WHEN setting priors THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate ranges for anisotropic BAO parameters
3. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL handle the directional components of BAO measurements
4. IF invalid parameter combinations are specified THEN the system SHALL reject the configuration with clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the BAO anisotropic fit to integrate with the existing pipeline infrastructure, so that it maintains consistency with other fitting modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fit runs THEN the system SHALL use the existing fit_core engine and parameter management
2. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL follow the same format as other pipeline results
3. WHEN logging occurs THEN the system SHALL use the established logging framework
4. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them using the existing error management system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to execute BAO anisotropic fits through a dedicated script, so that I can easily run this analysis type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the BAO anisotropic script THEN the system SHALL execute the fit with appropriate configuration
2. WHEN the script completes THEN the system SHALL save results in the standard output format
3. WHEN multiple runs occur THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent executions safely
4. IF the script fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the BAO anisotropic fit results to be validated against known benchmarks, so that I can trust the implementation accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL compare results against previous code implementations
2. WHEN discrepancies are found THEN the system SHALL report the differences with statistical significance
3. WHEN results match expectations THEN the system SHALL confirm successful validation
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information about the failures
