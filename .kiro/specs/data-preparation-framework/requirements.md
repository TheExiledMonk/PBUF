# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PBUF Data Preparation & Derivation Framework transforms raw cosmological datasets into validated, standardized, and reproducible analysis-ready forms. This framework extends the existing PBUF infrastructure by introducing a unifying layer for dataset processing and normalization, ensuring all datasets entering the PBUF fitting pipelines share consistent structure, units, metadata schema, and provenance traceability.

## Requirements

### Scope

These requirements apply to all dataset preparation and derivation processes between verified raw downloads and analysis-ready files. They exclude downstream model fitting and visualization components.

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cosmological researcher, I want all datasets to be transformed into a standardized internal format, so that I can use any dataset type with the fitting pipelines without manual preprocessing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a verified raw dataset is processed THEN the system SHALL output data in a common internal format with fields: z (redshift array), observable (measured quantity), uncertainty (one-sigma uncertainty), covariance (optional N×N matrix), and metadata (source, citation, version info)
2. WHEN processing any dataset type (SN, BAO, CMB, CC, RSD) THEN the system SHALL ensure all outputs conform to the same schema regardless of input format
3. WHEN a dataset lacks required fields THEN the system SHALL reject the dataset with clear error messages indicating missing components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the framework to support extensible dataset-specific processing modules, so that new dataset types can be added without modifying core system logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new dataset type is introduced THEN the system SHALL support adding it through a plugin-like derivation profile without core code changes
2. WHEN a derivation profile is defined THEN it SHALL specify input schema expectations, required transformations, and validation functions
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL dynamically detect and load all available derivation profiles
4. IF a derivation profile is malformed THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other valid profiles

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher ensuring scientific reproducibility, I want complete traceability of all data transformations, so that every analysis result can be fully reconstructed and verified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dataset is processed THEN the system SHALL record source manifest entry and checksum, transformation steps applied, derived file checksum and creation timestamp, and software environment hash
2. WHEN a derived dataset is created THEN the system SHALL automatically register it in the central provenance system with complete lineage information
3. WHEN the same raw input is reprocessed THEN the system SHALL produce identical output with matching checksum hashes (deterministic behavior)
4. WHEN provenance is queried THEN the system SHALL provide full traceability from raw downloads to final cosmological fits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive validation at each processing stage, so that invalid or corrupted data cannot enter the analysis pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data enters any processing stage THEN the system SHALL validate schema compliance (fields and datatypes), numerical sanity (no NaNs, infinities, negative variances), covariance matrix properties (symmetry and positive-definiteness), and redshift range consistency
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL halt processing and generate detailed error reports with specific failure reasons
3. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL generate quality assurance summaries and log any warnings
4. WHEN covariance matrices are present THEN the system SHALL verify they are symmetric and positive-definite

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cosmologist working with different dataset types, I want dataset-specific transformations to be applied correctly, so that physical quantities are properly derived and units are standardized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing Supernovae data THEN the system SHALL clean duplicates, homogenize calibration, convert magnitudes, apply covariance matrices, and extract z–μ–σμ columns
2. WHEN processing BAO data THEN the system SHALL separate isotropic/anisotropic points, convert distance measures to consistent units, and compute derived ratios (D_V(z)/r_d, D_M(z)/r_d, H(z)r_d)
3. WHEN processing CMB data THEN the system SHALL extract R, l_A, θ_* from Planck files, ensure correct cosmological constants, and check dimensionless consistency
4. WHEN processing Cosmic Chronometers data THEN the system SHALL merge data from multiple compilations, filter overlapping redshift bins, and propagate uncertainties
5. WHEN processing RSD data THEN the system SHALL validate growth-rate sign conventions and homogenize covariance from published sources

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the framework to integrate seamlessly with existing PBUF infrastructure, so that it works with the current downloader registry and fitting pipelines without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the framework starts THEN it SHALL interface directly with the existing downloader registry to retrieve verified raw datasets and metadata
2. WHEN datasets are processed THEN the system SHALL store derived datasets ("analysis-ready datasets" in PBUF terminology) in formats compatible with existing fitting pipelines (CSV, Parquet, or NumPy)
3. WHEN integration with fitting pipelines occurs THEN derived datasets SHALL load cleanly without requiring additional transformations
4. WHEN the central registry is updated THEN provenance entries SHALL be written using the existing registry interface

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can diagnose issues and monitor system health effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any processing step occurs THEN the system SHALL log all transformation steps in human-readable form with explicit formula references for physical quantity derivations
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL generate detailed error messages with context about the failing dataset and processing step
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL generate processing summaries suitable for publication inclusion
4. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL maintain performance metrics and processing statistics

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a researcher validating system correctness, I want comprehensive testing capabilities, so that I can verify the framework works correctly across all supported dataset types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema compliance tests run THEN the system SHALL verify each derived dataset conforms to the standardized internal schema
2. WHEN numerical integrity tests run THEN the system SHALL check covariance matrix positive-definiteness, finite numerical values, and monotonicity/redshift sanity
3. WHEN round-trip tests run THEN the system SHALL re-derive datasets from raw inputs and produce identical checksum hashes for derived outputs when run with identical inputs and environment hashes
4. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL verify derived datasets load cleanly into fitting pipelines
5. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL be certified ready for production use with 100% of Phase A datasets (CMB, SN, BAO iso/aniso)

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator deploying the framework, I want reliable performance and cross-platform compatibility, so that the system operates consistently across different environments and meets operational requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the framework processes all Phase A datasets THEN it SHALL complete full dataset derivation within a defined runtime threshold on reference hardware
2. WHEN the framework runs on different operating systems THEN it SHALL operate consistently across Linux/Mac/Windows environments
3. WHEN the framework uses parallelization THEN it SHALL only use deterministic parallelization methods that do not introduce race-condition variance in outputs
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the framework SHALL gracefully handle memory and disk space limitations with clear error messages
