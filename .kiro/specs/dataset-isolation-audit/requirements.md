# Dataset Isolation Audit Requirements

## Introduction

The Dataset Isolation Audit system ensures that every fit_* module only accesses its designated datasets and prevents any accidental "mixing and matching" between fits. This system provides comprehensive verification of dataset access patterns, registry provenance tracking, and cache isolation to maintain scientific integrity and reproducibility.

The audit system addresses critical security and data integrity concerns by implementing strict dataset access controls, comprehensive logging, and automated violation detection across all fitting modules in the PBUF cosmology pipeline.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Module Dataset Access Verification

**User Story:** As a cosmology researcher, I want to verify that each fitting module only accesses its designated datasets, so that I can ensure scientific integrity and prevent accidental data contamination between different analyses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit system scans a fit module THEN it SHALL identify all datasets accessed during module initialization and execution
2. WHEN a fit module accesses a dataset THEN the system SHALL record the dataset ID, filename, registry hash, and access timestamp
3. WHEN comparing against the whitelist THEN the system SHALL flag any dataset access that violates the module's allowed dataset list
4. IF a module accesses an unauthorized dataset THEN the system SHALL generate a "violation: unexpected dataset access" alert
5. IF a dataset is loaded under an alias or mismatched path THEN the system SHALL generate a "warning: potential cross-reference" alert

### Requirement 2: Dataset Whitelist Enforcement

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to enforce strict dataset whitelists for each fitting module, so that I can maintain clear separation between different cosmological analyses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load the predefined dataset whitelist for each fit module
2. WHEN validating fit_sn THEN it SHALL only allow access to sn_pantheon_plus dataset
3. WHEN validating fit_bao THEN it SHALL only allow access to bao_dr16_isotropic dataset  
4. WHEN validating fit_bao_aniso THEN it SHALL only allow access to bao_dr16_anisotropic dataset
5. WHEN validating fit_cmb THEN it SHALL only allow access to cmb_planck2018_distance_priors dataset
6. WHEN validating fit_joint THEN it SHALL allow access to cmb_planck2018_distance_priors, sn_pantheon_plus, bao_dr16_isotropic, and bao_dr16_anisotropic datasets
7. IF cc and rsd modules exist THEN the system SHALL enforce their respective dataset restrictions

### Requirement 3: Registry Provenance Validation

**User Story:** As a data integrity officer, I want to verify that all datasets have valid registry entries with correct checksums, so that I can ensure data authenticity and prevent corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing dataset access THEN the system SHALL cross-check that all used datasets have valid registry entries
2. WHEN validating a dataset THEN the system SHALL verify that the SHA256 checksum matches the manifest record
3. WHEN checking provenance THEN the system SHALL confirm no shared provenance tags exist between unrelated fits
4. IF a dataset lacks a registry entry THEN the system SHALL flag it as "missing registry validation"
5. IF checksums don't match THEN the system SHALL flag it as "checksum verification failure"
6. WHEN multiple modules access the same dataset THEN the system SHALL verify they use identical registry entries

### Requirement 4: Cache Contamination Detection

**User Story:** As a pipeline developer, I want to detect cache contamination between different fitting modules, so that I can prevent one module's cached data from affecting another module's results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning cache directories THEN the system SHALL identify all cached data files and their associated modules
2. WHEN a module requests cached data THEN the system SHALL verify the cache belongs to the requesting module
3. IF a module accesses another fit's cache THEN the system SHALL flag it as "cache contamination"
4. WHEN validating cache integrity THEN the system SHALL check that cache keys include module identifiers
5. IF shared cache entries exist THEN the system SHALL verify they are explicitly allowed for joint operations

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Audit Reporting

**User Story:** As a quality assurance analyst, I want detailed audit reports showing dataset access patterns and violations, so that I can assess system compliance and identify potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit completes THEN the system SHALL generate a structured report with all findings
2. WHEN reporting violations THEN the system SHALL include module name, dataset accessed, violation type, and timestamp
3. WHEN no violations are found THEN the system SHALL report "All fit modules confirmed isolated"
4. WHEN violations exist THEN the system SHALL provide a structured report listing modules and datasets needing correction
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include dataset hashes, provenance IDs, and cache usage summaries
6. IF suspicious cross-access is detected THEN the system SHALL highlight affected modules with warning indicators

### Requirement 6: Real-time Monitoring Integration

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want real-time monitoring of dataset access patterns, so that I can detect violations as they occur and take immediate corrective action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a fit module initializes THEN the system SHALL begin monitoring its dataset access patterns
2. WHEN unauthorized access occurs THEN the system SHALL generate immediate alerts
3. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL log all dataset load operations with timestamps
4. IF patterns indicate potential contamination THEN the system SHALL trigger automated warnings
5. WHEN audit mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide live status updates during execution

### Requirement 7: Historical Access Pattern Analysis

**User Story:** As a compliance auditor, I want to analyze historical dataset access patterns, so that I can identify trends and ensure long-term compliance with isolation requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing historical data THEN the system SHALL provide access pattern summaries over specified time periods
2. WHEN generating trend reports THEN the system SHALL identify modules with frequent violations
3. WHEN reviewing compliance THEN the system SHALL show improvement or degradation in isolation adherence
4. IF new violation patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL highlight them in trend analysis
5. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL export historical data in standard formats for external analysis

### Requirement 8: Automated Remediation Suggestions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated suggestions for fixing dataset isolation violations, so that I can quickly resolve issues and maintain system compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation recommendations
2. WHEN suggesting fixes THEN the system SHALL include code examples and configuration changes
3. WHEN multiple violations exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize recommendations by severity
4. IF configuration errors cause violations THEN the system SHALL suggest specific configuration corrections
5. WHEN remediation is applied THEN the system SHALL verify the fix resolves the violation

### Requirement 9: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the audit system to integrate seamlessly with existing registry and preparation frameworks, so that I can leverage current infrastructure without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with the dataset registry THEN the system SHALL use existing registry APIs for provenance verification
2. WHEN working with the preparation framework THEN the system SHALL respect existing data processing workflows
