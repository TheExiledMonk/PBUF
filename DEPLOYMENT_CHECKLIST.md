# PBUF Cosmology Pipeline - Deployment Checklist

Generated by Task 12.3 final validation

## Pre-Deployment Validation

- [ ] Numerical equivalence tests pass (CRITICAL)
- [ ] All integrity checks pass (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Wrapper scripts functional (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Deployment Steps

1. **Backup existing legacy system**
   - Command: `cp -r legacy_system/ backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)/`
   - Verification: Verify backup integrity

2. **Install unified pipeline dependencies**
   - Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Verification: python -c 'from pipelines.fit_core.engine import run_fit'

3. **Run final validation tests**
   - Command: `python task_12_3_final_validation.py`
   - Verification: All critical tests pass

4. **Deploy wrapper scripts**
   - Command: `Update analysis scripts to use pipelines/fit_*.py`
   - Verification: Test wrapper script execution

5. **Run parallel validation**
   - Command: `python pipelines/run_parity_tests.py --comprehensive`
   - Verification: Parity tests pass within tolerance

6. **Monitor production usage**
   - Command: `Set up automated monitoring`
   - Verification: Results consistent with expectations

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

- Daily performance monitoring
- Weekly result validation against baselines
- Monthly comprehensive parity testing
- Quarterly system integrity verification

## Rollback Procedure

1. Stop all production jobs using unified system
2. Restore legacy system from backup
3. Investigate and document issues
4. Fix issues in unified system
5. Re-run validation tests
6. Plan re-deployment
