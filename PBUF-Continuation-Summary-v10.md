1 · Background

The Planck-Bound Unified Framework (PBUF) introduces a Lorentz-covariant elastic stress tensor σ<sub>μν</sub> that bounds curvature and stress at the Planck limit.
This replaces the cosmological constant Λ with finite vacuum rigidity, removing singularities and unifying GR with quantum-scale stress expectations.
Empirical validation across Pantheon+SH0ES (SN), BOSS DR12 (BAO), and Planck 2018 (CMB) yields
ΔAIC ≈ −372 vs ΛCDM with only one additional parameter (kₛₐₜ ≈ 0.976).
All results are reproducible via open-source code and datasets archived under Zenodo DOI (issued upon acceptance).

2 · Current Status

Mathematical layer: fully derived, covariant, ghost-free, and curvature-bounded.

Empirical layer: SN + BAO + CMB joint fit verified; ΛCDM recovered as low-strain limit.

Publication: unified manuscript, mathematical supplement, empirical summary, and proof dossier submitted to CERN Zenodo (Theoretical Physics Community, under review).

Next validation: independent replication by external cosmologists pending peer review.

3 · Phase 2 Objectives (2025 – 2026)
Domain	Objective	Deliverable
Gravitational Waves (GW)	Incorporate standard-siren distance D<sub>L</sub><sup>GW</sup> vs D<sub>L</sub><sup>EM</sup> tests using LIGO/Virgo DR GWTC-3.	Predicted Δt and amplitude-strain correlations under elastic-vacuum correction.
Redshift Space Distortions (RSD)	Extend PBUF background to growth fσ₈(z).	Comparative fit to DESI and SDSS RSD data.
CMB Lensing / ISW	Evaluate late-time rigidity influence on lensing amplitude A<sub>L</sub> and ISW cross-correlations.	Cross-check Planck lensing likelihoods; produce full Boltzmann-solver plug-in.
Quantum Microphysics Link	Formalize σ<sub>μν</sub> expectation value from Planck-scale stress operators.	Analytical paper + numeric demonstration (Phase 3).
4 · Resources Requested
Resource Type	Description	Estimated Need
Computational	Access to cluster or HPC nodes capable of running full Boltzmann solver chains (CAMB/CLASS mod).	≈ 10 000 CPU hours
Collaboration	Partnership with at least one cosmology group for joint fit replication.	1–2 collaborating institutions
Funding (operational)	Stipend or grant to sustain independent analysis and publication costs over 12 months.	≈ USD 30 000–50 000 equivalent
Mentorship / Advisory	Senior GR or cosmology advisor for peer review navigation and paper submission strategy.	1 PI / mentor position
5 · Expected Outcomes (12 Months)

v10 Release: GW + RSD extended model and posterior sampling (WAIC/LOO validation).

Peer-review submission: “Elastic Spacetime Cosmology — Planck-Bound Extension of GR.”

Open data release: updated datasets and analysis code with Zenodo DOI.

Community integration: presentation proposal to CERN Theory or Perimeter Institute seminars.

6 · Significance

If independent analyses confirm PBUF’s statistical preference and internal consistency, the model may provide a geometric explanation for cosmic acceleration without invoking dark energy, while remaining fully compatible with General Relativity and Planck-scale limits.
The project thus represents a unique bridge between empirical cosmology and quantum-gravity phenomenology, suitable for collaboration, replication, and institutional sponsorship.
