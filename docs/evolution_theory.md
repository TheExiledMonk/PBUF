# Elastic Saturation Calibration with CMB Distance Priors

The cosmic microwave background provides the cleanest probe of the PBUF saturation stiffness `k_sat`.
By matching the observed acoustic angular scale (θ*) and related distance priors to Planck's 2018
release we anchor the early-time elastic response without invoking a perturbation solver. The new
pipeline integrates the Hu & Sugiyama recombination estimate, sound-horizon integrals, and a
compressed likelihood to connect high-curvature behaviour at recombination with the late-time
parameters constrained by supernovae.

This calibration is not about "fitting Planck" — it ties a physical material parameter of spacetime
(the saturation stiffness) to an epoch where the medium's response approached its Planck-bound limit.
Joint SN+CMB fits ensure that the same set of parameters explains distances from low redshift all the
way back to recombination.
