🌌 FUTURE.md — Planck-Bound Unified Framework Roadmap

Author: Fabian Olesen
Project: PBUF v3 (Planck-Bound Unified Framework)
Current Phase: A — Background & Late-Time Cosmology Validation
DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17394412

🧭 Overview

The PBUF v3 codebase is a stable empirical platform for testing an elastic-spacetime cosmology against late-time data (CMB, SN, BAO, CC, RSD).
Phase A verifies background expansion, statistical parity, and reproducibility.
Subsequent phases will extend the framework toward perturbation growth, quantum-scale curvature limits, and physical interpretation.

🚀 Planned Phases

A	Late-time expansion fits	Verify PBUF vs ΛCDM on CMB, SN, BAO, CC, RSD	v3 engine + proof dossier
B	Structure growth & gravitational waves	Extend to growth factor fσ₈(z), CMB lensing, GW distance ladder	Perturbation module + Phase B paper
C	High-redshift and early-universe	Reconstruct rₛ and recombination physics; simulate Big Bounce conditions	Early-universe paper + rₛ validation
D	Microphysics & quantum limit	Implement Planck-scale elasticity and vacuum stress tensor models	Quantum microphysics module
E	Numerical simulation suite	Full 3-D elastic-metric simulation using GPU/Vulkan compute	PBUF sim engine + visualization
F	Observational forecasting	Test PBUF predictions for future missions (Euclid, Roman, LiteBIRD)	Forecast paper + collab release

📊 Visualization Roadmap

Add interactive Plotly dashboards (zoom/pan) in Phase B.

Generate publication-ready multi-panel comparison figures (ΛCDM vs PBUF).

3-D elastic curvature animations for outreach & presentations.

🔐 Data & Reproducibility Roadmap

Implement automatic dataset version pinning via DOIs.

Add checksum registry for each Zenodo release.

Integrate OSF mirror for long-term dataset archival.

Continuous-integration test for joint-fit reproducibility (GitHub Actions).

🧮 Planned Scientific Extensions
1️⃣ Perturbation Module (Phase B)

Solve linear growth ODE for PBUF elastic term.

Compare to ΛCDM fσ₈(z) curves.

Add CMB lensing and ISW effects.

2️⃣ Quantum Microphysics (Phase D)

Formalize vacuum elastic constant kₛₐₜ as Planck-limit tension.

Compute energy density spectrum vs ΛCDM dark energy.

Derive entropy monotonicity and bounce conditions.

3️⃣ Elastic Spacetime Simulation (Phase E)

Build 3-D numerical solver for metric strain tensor fields.

GPU (Vulkan or CUDA) back-end.

Output wavefront snapshots & strain maps for visualization.

💡 Future Features

Checkpoint Resumption: resume interrupted fits via cached JSON states.

Batch Compute Mode: automatic parallelization on multi-core servers.

Web Dashboard: host Phase A results and plots publicly through GitHub Pages.

API Export: REST endpoint for retrieving fit results and parameters.

Interactive Equation Browser: render and annotate LaTeX expressions used in the paper.

🧭 Collaboration & Funding Plan

Release Phase A as public DOI snapshot (“data + code + results”).

Seek academic or private partnerships for Phase B compute runs.

Provide summary PDF and live dashboard to potential sponsors.

Encourage external reproduction via Zenodo and GitHub.

🔭 Ultimate Goal

To show that spacetime elasticity—a single, simple physical assumption—can unify:

cosmic acceleration,

dark sector phenomena,

and singularity avoidance,

while remaining consistent with existing observations and reducing the parameter count of ΛCDM.
